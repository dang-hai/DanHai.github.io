Hi, I'm Hai Dang, a third-year Ph.D. student in the HCI+AI research group at the University of Bayreuth, where I'm supervised by [Prof. Daniel Buschek](http://www.daniel-buschek.de/intro). Before starting my Ph.D., I obtained my B.Sc. in Media Informatics and M.Sc. in Computer Science from [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html). Additionally, I had the opportunity to spend a year studying at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr) in South Korea during my undergraduate studies.

My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Applied Machine Learning. Specifically, I develop interactive systems and conduct comprehensive user studies using both qualitative and quantitative UX methods to enhance users' interactions with generative systems for creative tasks. My work has been featured in prestigious venues in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, such as CHI, UIST, and IUI.

Aside from
