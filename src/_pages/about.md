My name is Hai Dang. I'm a second year a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.hciai.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html">HCI+AI research group</a> at the University of Bayreuth under the supervision of <a href="http://www.daniel-buschek.de/intro">Dr. Daniel Buschek</a>. I grew up in Munich where I did my Bachelor in Media Informatics and Master in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html">LMU Munich</a>.

My reserach revolves around **Human-Computer-Interaction** and **Applied Machine Learning**. I build interactive systems and conduct in-depth **users studies** using **qualitative and quantitative UX methods** to understand and improve how users control generative models. My work has been published at premier venues in the field of Human-Computer-Interaction including CHI and IUI.

Through my **co-creative systems** I enable users to create more expressive digital content by leveraging vast amount of training data. My previous project, - <a href="{% post_url 2022-02-01-ganslider %}">GANSlider</a> - has looked into user interfaces for the control of generative models for images (e.g. GAN) and proposes improvements by visually aiding the users. <a href="{% post_url 2021-02-01-gesturemap %}">GestureMap</a>, on the other hand, is an interactive tool that uses a deep generative model trained on motion data, to analyse user gestures for the control of interactive systems.

Currently, I investigate **writing support tools** that use natural language processing (**NLP**) and large language models (**LLM**) to help users in their (creative) writing process. **Prompt engineering** research has already shown promising results in the optimization of textual prompts for LLMs, however, for many non-ml users, prompting is still a trial and error process. I view the prompt writing paradigm from a HCI perspective and conceptualize new interactive tools to help users write better textual prompts.
