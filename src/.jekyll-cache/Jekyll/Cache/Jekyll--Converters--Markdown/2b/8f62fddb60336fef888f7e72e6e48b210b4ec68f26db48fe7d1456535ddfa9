<p>My name is Hai Dang. Iâ€™m a second year a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.hciai.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html">HCI+AI research group</a> at the University of Bayreuth under the supervision of <a href="http://www.daniel-buschek.de/intro">Dr. Daniel Buschek</a>. I grew up in Munich where I did my Bachelor in Media Informatics and Master in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html">LMU Munich</a>.</p>

<p>My reserach revolves around <strong>Human-Computer-Interaction</strong> and <strong>Applied Machine Learning</strong>. I build interactive systems and conduct in-depth <strong>users studies</strong> using <strong>qualitative and quantitative UX methods</strong> to understand and improve how users control generative models. My work has been published at premier venues in the field of Human-Computer-Interaction including CHI and IUI.</p>

<p>Through my <strong>co-creative systems</strong> I enable users to create more expressive digital content by leveraging vast amount of training data. My previous project, - <a href="/ganslider">GANSlider</a> - has looked into user interfaces for the control of generative models for images (e.g. GAN) and proposes improvements by visually aiding the users. <a href="/gesturemap">GestureMap</a>, on the other hand, is an interactive tool that uses a deep generative model trained on motion data, to analyse user gestures for the control of interactive systems.</p>

<p>Currently, I investigate <strong>writing support tools</strong> that use natural language processing (<strong>NLP</strong>) and large language models (<strong>LLM</strong>) to help users in their (creative) writing process. <strong>Prompt engineering</strong> research has already shown promising results in the optimization of textual prompts for LLMs, however, for many non-ml users, prompting is still a trial and error process. I view the prompt writing paradigm from a HCI perspective and conceptualize new interactive tools to help users write better textual prompts.</p>
