Hi, my name is Hai Dang. I'm starting my second year as a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.hciai.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html">HCI+AI research group</a> under the supervision of <a href="www.daniel-buschek.de">Dr. Daniel Buschek</a>. My roots are Vietnamese, but I was born and raised in Germany. I grew up in Munich where I did a Bachelor in Media Informatics and Master in Computer Science at the <a href="www.uni-muenchen.de">University Munich</a>.

My general research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer-Interaction and Applied Machine Learning. Recent advances in generative AI through deep learning approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and large language models will enable new kinds of user experiences around content creation, across a range of media types. Given the increased relevance of such generative systems, I design and build new interactive systems that empower domain-experts as well as non-machine learning expert users to create new content with an unprecedented level of fidelity.
