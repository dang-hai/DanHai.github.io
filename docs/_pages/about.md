My name is Hai Dang. I'm a second year a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.hciai.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html">HCI+AI research group</a> at the University of Bayreuth under the supervision of <a href="http://www.daniel-buschek.de/intro">Dr. Daniel Buschek</a>. My roots are Vietnamese, but I was born and raised in Germany. I grew up in Munich where I did my Bachelor in Media Informatics and Master in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html">LMU Munich</a>.

I do research at the intersection of **Human-Computer-Interaction** and **Applied Machine Learning**. I use machine learning and deep learning to build interactive prototypes to understand how users control generative models. My co-creative systems enable users to create more expressive digital content by leveraging vast amount of training data. For example, - <a href="{% post_url 2022-02-01-ganslider %}">GANSlider</a> - has looked into user interfaces for the control of generative models for images (e.g. GAN) and proposes improvements by visually aiding the users. <a href="{% post_url 2021-02-01-gesturemap %}">GestureMap</a>, on the other hand, is an interactive tool that uses a deep generative model trained on motion data, to analyse user gestures for the control of interactive systems.

I conduct in-depth **users studies** and employ **qualitative as well as quantitative UX methods** to better understand how interact with imperfect AI. My work is published at premier venues including CHI and IUI.

Currently, I'm also leading the educational efforts at <a href="https://tum-ai.com">TUM.ai</a> where we teach students from different disciplines foundational AI knowledge. By providing everyone with a basic understanding and a common AI vocabulary this program aims to pave the way for more effective communication and hopefully enable aspiring students to pursue their AI projects in an interdisciplinary setting.
