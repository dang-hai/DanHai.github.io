Hi, my name is Hai Dang. I'm a second year a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.hciai.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html">HCI+AI research group</a> under the supervision of <a href="www.daniel-buschek.de">Dr. Daniel Buschek</a>. My roots are Vietnamese, but I was born and raised in Germany. I grew up in Munich where I did my Bachelor in Media Informatics and Master in Computer Science at the <a href="www.uni-muenchen.de">LMU Munich</a>.

My general research interests lie at the intersection of **Human-Computer-Interaction** and **Applied Machine Learning**. In my research, I analyse generative systems and how users can interactively use them to create more expressive digitial content. These so-called, co-creative systems envision a close Human AI relationship where both parties intelligently contribute to the final outcome. They enable users to create media with high fidelity by leveraging on a vast amount of training data. For example, my recent work has looked on how user interfaces for the control of gerneative models for images (e.g. GAN) can be improved. In another project I have built an interactive tool, that leverages features learned by a generative model trained on motion data, to analyse user gestures for the of control interactive systems.

As part of my research work, I also conduct detailed **users studies** and apply **qualitative as well as quantititave analyses** to better understand the current opportunities and limitations of these still imperfect interactive AI systems. I am further interested in explainable and fair AI. My work is published at top-tier venues including CHI and IUI.

Currently, I am also leading the educational efforts at <a href="https://tum-ai.com">TUM.ai</a> were we teach students from different disciplines foundational AI knowledge. By providing everyone with a basic understanding and a common AI vocabulary this program aims to pave the way for more effective communication and hopefully enable aspiring students to pursue their AI projects in an interdisciplinary setting.

Feel free to reach out me if you want to collaborate in any form.
