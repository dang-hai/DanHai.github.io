My name is Hai Dang. I'm a second year a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.hciai.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html">HCI+AI research group</a> at the University of Bayreuth under the supervision of <a href="http://www.daniel-buschek.de/intro">Dr. Daniel Buschek</a>. My roots are Vietnamese, but I was born and raised in Germany. I grew up in Munich where I did my Bachelor in Media Informatics and Master in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html">LMU Munich</a>.

My general research interests lie at the intersection of **Human-Computer-Interaction** and **Applied Machine Learning**. In my research, I use machine learning and deep learning to build interactive prototypes to understand how users control generative models. These co-creative systems enable users to create more expressive digital content by leveraging vast amount of training data. For example, - <a href="{% post_url 2022-02-01-ganslider %}">GANSlider</a> - has looked into user interfaces for the control of generative models for images (e.g. GAN) and proposes improvements by visually aiding the users. <a href="{% post_url 2021-02-01-gesturemap %}">GestureMap</a>, on the other hand, is an interactive tool that uses a deep generative model trained on motion data, to analyse user gestures for the control of interactive systems.

As part of my research, I also conduct detailed **users studies** and apply **qualitative as well as quantitative analyses** to better understand the context in which humans collaborate with imperfect AI and develop design guidelines based on the study results. My work is published at premier venues including CHI and IUI.

Currently, I'm also leading the educational efforts at <a href="https://tum-ai.com">TUM.ai</a> where we teach students from different disciplines foundational AI knowledge. By providing everyone with a basic understanding and a common AI vocabulary this program aims to pave the way for more effective communication and hopefully enable aspiring students to pursue their AI projects in an interdisciplinary setting.
