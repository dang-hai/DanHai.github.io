My name is Hai Dang. I'm a second year a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.hciai.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html">HCI+AI research group</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.daniel-buschek.de/intro">Dr. Daniel Buschek</a>. My roots are Vietnamese, but I was born and raised in Germany. I grew up in Munich where I did my Bachelor in Media Informatics and Master in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html">LMU Munich</a>.

My general research interests lie at the intersection of **Human-Computer-Interaction** and **Applied Machine Learning**. In my research, I analyse how users can interactively use generative systems to create more expressive digitial content. In co-creative systems humans and AI form an equal relationship where both parties intelligently contribute to the final outcome. They enable users to create media with high fidelity by leveraging a vast amount of training data. My recent work - <a href="2021-02-01-ganslider">GANSlider</a> - has looked on how user interfaces for the control of generative models for images (e.g. GAN) can be improved. In another project I have built <a href="{% post_url 2021-02-01-gesturemap %}">GestureMap</a>, an interactive tool that uses features learned by a generative model trained on motion data, to analyse user gestures for the of control interactive systems.

As part of my research work, I also conduct detailed **users studies** and apply **qualitative as well as quantitative analyses** to better understand the current opportunities and limitations of these still imperfect interactive AI systems. My work is published at top-tier venues including CHI and IUI.

Currently, I'm also leading the educational efforts at <a href="https://tum-ai.com">TUM.ai</a> where we teach students from different disciplines foundational AI knowledge. By providing everyone with a basic understanding and a common AI vocabulary this program aims to pave the way for more effective communication and hopefully enable aspiring students to pursue their AI projects in an interdisciplinary setting.
